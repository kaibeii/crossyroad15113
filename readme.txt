I tried to keep it simple at first and asked for a plan. It created preliminary code and I trouble downloading pygame, but troubleshooted me through it. I added features one by one and fixed it based on what it gave me at first as to not overwhelm the client, since I did not want to deal with multiple issues at once. I used Chatgpt. After i got the majority of things like lane generation, cars, camera scrolling, I focused on how it looked like with the chicken, etc.
